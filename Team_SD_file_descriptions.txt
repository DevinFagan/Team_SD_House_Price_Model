File descriptions:
EDA_doug.RMD: file for initial exploratory data analysis with R

fillna.py: module with fillna fxn to remove nas with random imputation, dummy_conv to do the categorical feature dummification and data_process which is the overall function to call all functions (including from ordinal_ranker module) to preprocess data

ordinal_ranker.py: module with ordinal_ranker fxn to change ordinal descriptions to squared continuous variables, value_check to remove/impute mistyped variables, to ensure we have correct levels, and feature_select to remove columns decided after correlation analysis.

house_train.csv: training data after cleaning/preprocessing, for storage

model_coef.py: script to create dataframe of coefficients from ridge, lasso and elastic net models that were examined.

numcor.csv: pearson r correlations between continous variables

pearson.ipynb: notebook with function to perform pearson r correlations

svr_regression_model_0530.py: script to call preprocessing functions, fit model and write out sample submission file.  Calls ordinal_ranker, fillna modules with preprocessing functions inside.

test.csv, train.csv: train is sample data from Kaggle, test are points to be predicted for Kaggle.

team_SD_submission_svr.csv: sample submission file for Kaggle

svr_notebook_052920_v2.ipynb: notebook with cross-validations of SVR model, and visualizations of residuals and model predictions.

rf_gbr_model.py: random forest and gradient boost regression model scripts

penalized_regression_models.ipyb and .py: notebook and scripts of penalized (elastic net, lasso and ridge) regression models.

house_price_present.pptx: presentation for team project
